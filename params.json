You can call with questions about anything from setting up a one computer in your home office, to a building with 50 computers and two servers. I can design and implement everything from residential needs to commercial needs. I have more than twenty years experience, and have worked for companies all over Louisiana. References are available. Please email me, support@sunuser.us, or call one of the above listed numbers.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nI can provide Remote Support using a small program (called a client) that you download from a safe, reputable site that allows me to take control of your computer to make changes as you watch. It makes telephone support much easier. You may call 24/7. I make no guarantee that I will be available when you call. I see clients first come, first served, except in cases of extreme emergency.  Cases will be evaluated on an on-going basis.  \r\n\r\nkevin p landerneau | kevin@sunuser.us\r\n",
