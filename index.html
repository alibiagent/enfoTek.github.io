<p>For all of your computer and networking needs, please call Kevin @ (337) 418-1717, or (318) 405-2020. You can call with questions about anything from setting up a one computer in your home office, to a building with 50 computers and two servers. I can design and implement everything from residential needs to commercial needs. I have more than twenty years experience, and have worked for companies all over Louisiana. References are available. Please email me, <a href="mailto:support@sunuser.us">support@sunuser.us</a>, or call one of the above listed numbers.</p>

<p>I can provide Remote Support using a small program (called a client) that you download from a safe, reputable site that allows me to take control of your computer to make changes as you watch. It makes telephone support much easier. You may call 24/7. I make no guarantee that I will be available when you call. I see clients first come, first served, except in cases of extreme emergency.  Cases will be evaluated on an on-going basis.  </p>
